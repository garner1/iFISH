    "# Topological data analysis of spotting-probes point clouds\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a point cloud derived from three-dimensional probes locations we want to analyze the shape of data, for the purpose of studying statistics of chromosomal shapes in a given cell population, comparing different chromosomes and identifying recurrent topological patterns.\n",
    "Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a set of method allowing us to quantify the shape of the data in a rigorous manner. \n",

    "As the image above shows the idea is to expand spheres centered at each point, and while doing this to keep track of the number of connected components (b<sub>0</sub>), holes (b<sub>1</sub>) and voids (not shown in the figure) that emerge as a result of the expanding spheres radious ($\\epsilon$). A summary of this information is provided by persistent diagrams (top part of the figure below) and persistent barcodes (bottom part fo the figure below):\n",

    "One can then compare different topological summaries using the bottleneck and the Wasserstein distances.\n",

    "## Example with real data\n",
    "Let's consider the following dataset (UserDots_iEG408_003_d0_a594/014_006_1.csv):\n",

    "Now let's consider a second dataset (UserDots_iEG408_003_d0_a594/014_006_2.csv), the other homologue in the pair observed in the same nucleus. From this one we have the following plots:\n",

    "Having a pair of point clouds it is also possible to quantify the similarity between their topological features, and quantify the fluctuations present in the topological summary of the point-clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistics of distances between topological summaries\n",
    "Given two point clouds, for each we evaluate the persistent diagram and then we take the p-Wassertein distance (with p=2) between the two diagrams, divided by the number of points in the larger cloud of the pair. The distance is a function D depending on {chr#1, chr#2, dimension of the homological features (i.e. clusters, loops or voids)}. To start we consider the case where chr#1=chr#2=chromosome 1 (dataset UserDots_IEG364_004 with 16 clouds with at least 20 points) and we plot the distribution of distances between all point clouds with at least 20 points:\n",

    "We then consider chromosome 20 (dataset UserDots_iEG408_003_d0_a594 with 28 clouds with at least 20 points):\n",
    "<img src=\"2wd_chr20_dim0_28clouds.png\">\n",
    "<img src=\"2wd_chr20_dim1_28clouds.png\">\n",
    "We then consider chromosome 2 (dataset UserDots_iEG408_003_d0_cy5 with 69 clouds with at least 20 points):\n",

    "And here is a violin plot summarizing the statistics for dim = 0 (clusters):\n",

    "and for dim = 1 (loops):\n",
